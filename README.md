# Ultimate Frisbee Team Network Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive network analysis of ultimate frisbee teams across two regions (North Central and Northwest), exploring their game connections, network characteristics, and community structures.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Game connections from Sectionals, Regionals, and Nationals
- **Regions**: North Central and Northwest
- **Analysis Focus**: Team interactions, network topology, and centrality

## Key Findings

### Network Characteristics
- **Vertices**: Total number of teams
- **Edges**: Total number of game connections
- **Network Diameter**: 7 links
- **Average Path Length**: 3.409
- **Clustering Coefficient**: 0.486

### Centrality Analysis
Most Central Teams:
1. Red Flag
2. Drag'n Thrust
3. NOISE

### Network Robustness
- **Attack Tolerance**: 0.377
- **Network Robustness**: 0.951

### Community Structure
